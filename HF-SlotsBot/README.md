# Hackforums Slots Bot 🤖🎲
This is a very simple bot that will keep placing credit bets until you hit either your "Safety Switch". This bot is really only good for farming the Dice award and nothing else.


## How To Use / Tampermonkey 🤖🐵
1) Install <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/">Tampermonkey</a>
2) Click <a href="https://openuserjs.org/install/Joel/Hackforums_Slot_Bot.user.js">Here</a>
3) Make sure the script is enabled and so is Tampermonkey
4) Proceed to the <a href="https://hackforums.net/slots.php">Slots</a> and it'll start automatically.

The bot will now run until it hits your safety switch.

## Extra Information
> soundManager.mute(); mutes the bot for you. So you don't need to do it manually.

> var safetySwitchAmount is set to "0" by default. You should change this to how many bytes you want the script to stop at. If you forget don't come crying to me when you've lost everything.

> Tampermonkey Script is 500ms Slower due to execution time.

I also don't know if this bot is allowed or not. So <b>USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!</b>
